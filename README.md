# pyGAMcsharpIntegration

This repo shows calling python in c#.
pyGAM is used to find correlated series in dataset, creates a model from that series to predict next candle, displays effects using charting widget and logs profit/loss in console.

You need to copy StatisticalFrowOnSeries/DLLs and StatisticalFrowOnSeries/Libs to where exe file is created on build to let it run. Python needs these dirs, they are libs for python.
